Leap Motion Virtual Theremin Project 
Version 1.0 (2/25/2014)

#### General Information

Our virtual theremin project was created by: 
Hugh Adam, Heba Bubakr, Sarah Murray, Grant Stewart, and Ian Logan.

We are using the [Leap Motion API](https://developer.leapmotion.com) and developer tools to create a virtual theremin.
Using MIDI tools such as [MaxMSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/), we map various sections of the space above the 
Leap Motion device to recreate an authentic experience of playing a theremin.
