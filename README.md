Version 1.0 (2/25/2014)

GENERAL INFORMATION
========

Our virtual theremin project was created by:
Hugh Adam, Heba Bubakr, Sarah Murray, Grant Stewart, and Ian Logan.

We are using the Leap Motion API and developer tools to create a virtual theremin.
Using MIDI tools such as MaxMSP, we map various sections of the space above the 
Leap Motion device to recreate an authentic experience of playing a theremin.
